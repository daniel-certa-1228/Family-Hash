# Family Hash

Define a hash that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.

my_family = {
    :sister => {
        :name => 'Krista',
        :age => 42
    },
    :mother => {
        :name => 'Cathie',
        :age => 70
    }
}

Using array methods, produce output that looks like the following example.

Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
